# EntropyLab
## DO NOT USE WITH ACTUAL BITCOIN IN ANY WAY. ENTROPY LAB IS FOR TESTNET | SIGNET | REGTEST USE ONLY

EntropyLab is a self-contained Bitcoin key and wallet calculator designed for
offline, air-gapped use. It converts user-supplied entropy, seed phrases, and
private keys into wallet recovery information without intentionally sending
sensitive data to a server.

Current version: **v0.1.3**

Official website: [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online)

## Features

- Accepts dice rolls, coin flips, hexadecimal entropy, BIP39 seed phrases,
  extended keys, WIF keys, raw private keys, and Casascius mini private keys.
  All five BIP39 phrase lengths (12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 words) are supported
  for every entropy entry method.
- Derives BIP39 seeds, BIP32 extended keys, wallet fingerprints, addresses,
  and Bitcoin Core-compatible descriptors. Each master fingerprint is shown
  next to its deterministic [LifeHash](https://lifehash.info) icon so two
  keys can be told apart at a glance.
- Supports legacy, nested SegWit, native SegWit, and Taproot single-signature
  address types. Derivation-scheme presets cover the BIP44, BIP49, BIP84,
  BIP86, and six-level BIP48 layouts and label each path level accordingly.
  A custom mode accepts an arbitrary-depth BIP32 account path, keeps Bitcoin
  network selection explicit, and appends the selected branch and address
  ranges. Typing `h` or `'` after a preset index enables its Harden control.
- Supports numeric coin-type and account indexes for single-signature and
  multisignature derivation. Purpose, coin type, and account indexes are
  hardened by default; the starting address index is unhardened by default.
  Each can be changed independently. Coin type 0 uses Bitcoin Mainnet, coin
  type 1 uses Bitcoin Testnet, and custom indexes retain Mainnet address
  serialization. Hardened address children require private key material and
  therefore cannot be derived from multisig co-signer xpubs.
  PSBT address rendering separately supports Mainnet and Testnet.
- Derives watch-only multisignature wallets from extended public keys without
  requiring private keys. Multisig script type and purpose are separate as
  well; conventional script choices restore their standard purpose, while
  pasted co-signer origins auto-detect and must agree with the selected path
  indexes and hardening choices.
- Inspects PSBT v0 transactions, reports PSBT-provided amounts and fees, checks
  for repeated ECDSA nonces from the same public key — including signatures
  carried by finalized scriptSig/witness fields, which are decoded and analyzed
  rather than skipped — verifies optional Jade
  anti-exfil (sign-to-contract) transcripts without a key, and can compare supported
  SegWit v0 SIGHASH_ALL signatures with RFC 6979, including Bitcoin Core-style low-r grinding, in a temporary session.
  Every input's declared sighash policy and each signature's appended sighash
  byte are decoded without a key; anything other than exact SIGHASH_ALL is a
  blocking warning. Finalized signatures that cannot be decoded or associated
  with a key block any clean nonce verdict.
- Accepts a fully signed raw Bitcoin transaction (hex or base64) in the same
  inspector: outputs, extracted ECDSA nonces, and inscription-envelope hints.
  Fee and RFC 6979 cannot be checked without previous outputs.
- With a session seed, root xprv, WIF, or hex key, labels each output as
  change, receive, or not in this wallet (accounts 0–2, 50 receive + 50
  change, all four script types). A two-or-more-output transaction with no
  matching change is a blocking warning. OP_RETURN outputs are decoded for size and a text/hex
  preview; the tool does not create data-carrier outputs.
- Scans PSBT tap-leaf scripts and finalized witnesses for inscription envelopes
  (`OP_FALSE OP_IF "ord"`). Reports content-type, size, and text previews; does
  not number sats, fetch chain data, create inscriptions, or render images.
- Edits PSBT v0 files field by field (a bip174.org-style editor backed by
  rust-bitcoin compiled to WebAssembly): a mempool.space-style
  transaction-flow diagram draws one box per input and output (claimed
  amount, address or script template, signing status) with per-column totals
  and bezier connectors into the unsigned transaction; selecting a box opens
  that key-value map for editing in a panel under the diagram, the
  transaction box opens the version/locktime fields, and output amounts edit
  directly in their boxes. Every key-value pair of the global,
  per-input, and per-output maps is decoded (BIP-174 and BIP-371 taproot
  fields), editable as raw hex, and removable, new pairs can be added, and the
  unsigned transaction's version, locktime, input prevouts/sequences, and
  output amounts/scripts get structured fields. Fields longer than 64
  characters (a whole previous transaction, a large script) collapse to a
  truncated preview with a length label; clicking the cell opens the full
  text in an editor window, where values stay editable. Re-serialization is
  validated by rust-bitcoin before the edited PSBT is shown. The editor never
  signs anything.
- Derives BIP-85 child entropy from the active key's BIP32 root (or a pasted
  root xprv): English BIP-39 mnemonics (12–24 words), HD-seed WIF, XPRV, HEX,
  and Base64/Base85 passwords. Same parent, application, and index always
  reproduce the same child — this is a calculator, not a generator. Children
  follow the published BIP-85 vectors and match COLDCARD, including derivation
  from a passphrase-extended root when a BIP-39 passphrase is in effect.
- Derives BIP-352 Silent Payment addresses (`sp1q…` / `tsp1q…`) from a seed or
  root xprv, including labeled codes, BIP-392 `spscan` / `spspend` descriptors,
  sender taproot outputs from pasted vin JSON, and receiver verification of
  pasted x-only outputs. This is a calculator: it does not scan the chain.
- Runs a quick barrage of startup sanity checks on the host browser (secure
  context, CSPRNG, BigInt, UTF-8 encoding, and NFKD normalization). If any
  check fails, the page is replaced with a failure report listing the failed
  checks, because wallet output from a broken host cannot be trusted.
- Produces recovery information that can be saved or printed for offline use.
- Exports a Bitcoin Core `wallet.dat` (SQLite descriptor wallet) with every
  derived output descriptor already imported — receive and change for each
  script type, active and ready for address generation. The default download
  is watch-only; while private recovery material is shown on screen, the
  export becomes the spending variant (account xprvs as descriptor keys) and
  the button says so. The descriptor birthday defaults to genesis so
  recovered keys are discovered by Bitcoin Core's initial scan; choose the
  "New keys" birthday only for entropy created at that moment. If a loaded
  wallet looks empty, repair it with `rescanblockchain 0` in Bitcoin Core.
  Generated database files match Bitcoin Core's own record layout
  byte-for-byte (verified against Bitcoin Core v28.3.0).

## Usage

Download the self-contained `entropylab.html` from the
[official website](https://entropylab.online) or the
[releases page](https://github.com/w-s-bitcoin/entropylab/releases), transfer it to a trusted
computer, disconnect that computer from all networks, and open the file in a
modern browser. For sensitive wallet material, use a dedicated air-gapped
machine and verify important addresses and descriptors with an independent
wallet or signing device before receiving funds.

To build the HTML file yourself, see [Building from source](#building-from-source).

### iPhone home-screen app

On iPhone, open [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online) in Safari, then
choose **Share → Add to Home Screen → Open as Web App → Add**. Keep the page
open until its first load completes. The hosted app stores the self-contained
calculator in a versioned browser cache so the Home Screen app can reopen when
the phone has no network connection.

Before entering any seed phrase, private key, or other secret wallet material,
disconnect every network available to the phone, reopen EntropyLab from the
Home Screen, and confirm that the header reports **Offline**. A cached page is
not proof of an air gap: the status is based on browser network signals, and the
hosted worker checks for application updates whenever the app is opened while
connected. Clearing Safari website data or removing the Home Screen app may
remove the cached copy.

For sensitive or long-term use, the recommended path remains the downloaded,
verified `entropylab.html` on a dedicated air-gapped computer. The downloaded
file is still self-contained and never registers the hosted service worker.

### Verifying the download

Every merge to `rock` publishes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` checksum manifest for
`entropylab.html` (committed next to it in this repository) and a
[GitHub artifact attestation](https://github.com/w-s-bitcoin/entropylab/attestations)
for the exact bytes built by CI. After downloading, verify both:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
gh attestation verify entropylab.html -R w-s-bitcoin/entropylab
```

The attestation is keyless (Sigstore) and bound to this repository's release
workflow, so it authenticates the artifact independently of the hosting
account. The checksum manifest alone only detects accidental corruption —
always pair it with the attestation or with your own rebuild from source,
which is byte-for-byte reproducible.

An online version is available at [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online)
for convenient access. Do not enter seed phrases, private keys, or other secret
wallet material into an internet-connected device; use the downloaded HTML on
a trusted air-gapped computer for sensitive operations.

EntropyLab does not generate wallet entropy. The optional BitBox Heads/Tails
controls use browser randomness only to choose an equivalent displayed die
face: 1–3 all mean Heads and 4–6 all mean Tails, so that numeric choice does not
change the resulting BitBox entropy. Wallet security still depends on the
quality and secrecy of the entropy, seed phrase, passphrase, or private key
supplied by the user.

## FAQ

### Does EntropyLab generate a seed or private key for me?

No. EntropyLab deterministically transforms entropy or key material that you
supply. It does not create secret wallet entropy. BIP-85 children are derived
from the parent root you provide and are reproducible from that same root,
application, and index.

### Can I enter a real seed phrase on the website?

Do not enter wallet secrets on an internet-connected device. Download the
self-contained HTML, verify it, transfer it to a trusted air-gapped computer,
and open it there. Keep backups and verify important results independently
before receiving funds.

### Does EntropyLab replace a hardware wallet or signing device?

No. EntropyLab is a calculator and verification tool. It can derive recovery
information, construct watch-only wallet data, and inspect supported PSBT
details, but it is not intended to be a transaction signer or broadcaster.
Use a separately verified wallet or signing device when spending bitcoin.

### How should I check an address or descriptor before using it?

Derive the same wallet with an independent implementation or signing device
and compare the address, derivation path, fingerprint, and descriptor. Do not
rely on matching only a shortened value or a visual icon.

### How do I know the downloaded HTML is authentic?

Follow [Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download). Check the SHA-256
manifest together with the GitHub artifact attestation, or build the file from
the reviewed source. A checksum by itself detects changed bytes but does not
authenticate who produced them.

### Why does EntropyLab accept short dice or card transcripts?

Short inputs are useful for deterministic tests, demonstrations, and recovery
experiments, so they are accepted with a warning. Hashing a short transcript
does not add entropy. Never secure funds with an input below the displayed
recommendation.

### How should I report a possible security problem?

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability involving incorrect
derivations, secret exposure, injected code, unexpected network access, or
possible loss of funds. Follow the private reporting instructions in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Building from source

The build bundles the application with esbuild and inlines the result into a
single self-contained HTML file. All Bitcoin cryptography is compiled to
WebAssembly from the pinned Rust crate (below); the only JavaScript package
bundled into the artifact is `uqr` (QR rendering). `package-lock.json` pins
the complete dependency tree and the integrity hash of every downloaded
package; the `@noble`/`@scure` packages remain as dev-only differential test
oracles, pinned and never bundled.

EntropyLab's cryptography — secp256k1 curve operations (public-key
derivation, ECDSA signing and verification in PSBT inspection, curve point
math), hashes (SHA-256, SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, HMAC-SHA-512,
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512), BIP32 extended-key derivation, BIP39 mnemonics,
Base58Check and bech32m encoding, and address/script construction
(p2pkh/p2sh/p2wpkh/p2tr, bare and taproot multisig) — runs on rust-bitcoin's
`secp256k1` crate (libsecp256k1 v0.4.1 vendored by secp256k1-sys 0.10.1),
`bitcoin`, `bitcoin_hashes`, `base58ck`, `bech32`, and `bip39`, compiled to
WebAssembly from the pinned Rust crate in `entropylab-wasm/` (exact crate
versions in `entropylab-wasm/Cargo.lock`, toolchain pinned by
`rust-toolchain.toml`) via the facades in `src/js/secp256k1.js`,
`src/js/hashes.js`, `src/js/hdkey.js`, `src/js/bip39.js`, `src/js/base58.js`,
`src/js/addresses.js`, and `src/js/bech32.js`. The only remaining JavaScript
bundled from npm is `uqr` (QR rendering; no cryptography). The compiled
artifact is committed as `src/js/entropylab-wasm-b64.js`, so building the
site needs only Node.js. CI
rebuilds it from the Rust sources, runs its test suite against the fresh
build, and commits the runner's copy back to `rock` after each merge (the
same flow as the site artifact; byte identity across machines is not
asserted, since the C side compiles with the builder's clang, and build-host
paths are remapped out of the binary).

PSBT parsing, typed field decoding, and re-serialization in the PSBT editor
run on rust-bitcoin 0.32.102 compiled to WebAssembly from the pinned crate in
`psbt-wasm/` (same pinning rules), exposed through `src/js/psbt-wasm.js` and
committed as `src/js/psbt-wasm-b64.js`. The WASM sees only PSBT bytes and
UTF-8 JSON; it holds no keys and generates no randomness.

Requirements: Node.js 20.19 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

To modify the Rust bindings (`entropylab-wasm/`, `psbt-wasm/`), Rust (with the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, installed automatically by rustup) is also
required; regenerate the committed artifacts with `npm run build:wasm`.

Build output (generated; CI rebuilds it for every run and commits it back to
`rock` after each merge so the file stays downloadable from the repository):

- `entropylab.html` — the self-contained application (open this file)

The version is declared once in `package.json` and substituted into the
output at build time. The generated file is gitignored locally; CI builds
it before every test run and commits it back to `rock` after each merge.
To remove generated files, run `npm run clean`.

## Development and deployment

The toolchain is npm and Node.js (>=20.19). Install the exact dependency tree
with `npm ci`; every local and CI operation is exposed as an npm script:

```bash
npm test                    # run all tests, including the headless-Firefox suite
npm run test:ci             # the CI subset: network-check, ui-defaults, source invariants
npm run test:validate       # validate source and security invariants
npm run test:browser        # test crypto, sanitization, networking, exports in headless Firefox
npm run build               # compile src/ into the generated root files
npm run build:wasm          # rebuild the committed crypto WASM artifact (needs Rust)
npm run verify              # verify the site artifact (entropylab.html, assets)
npm run ci                  # run the CI test subset, build, and verify in order
```

GitHub Actions builds the site first, then runs the same test steps for pull
requests and pushes to `rock`, stages the verified site (`entropylab.html`,
`assets/`) and deploys it to GitHub Pages. After a merge to
`rock`, a final job commits the rebuilt `entropylab.html`
back to the repository so the file stays downloadable; pull requests never
carry the generated output, so they stop conflicting on it. The staging step
copies the verified `entropylab.html` to a deployment-only `index.html`,
allowing both the site root and `/entropylab.html` to serve the same
application without committing a second application artifact. CI runs the
test suites that need no browser; the headless-Firefox suite runs locally
where a Firefox binary is available. Local checks and CI/CD use the same
commands; the workflow contains no separate build implementation.

The browser suite runs the assembled application in headless Firefox against a
local Node.js HTTP server. It feeds hostile markup and event-handler strings
through user-facing fields, verifies the application makes no network
requests at runtime, exercises the hosted warning and
assets, derives a known wallet through the UI, and inspects both watch-only
and private recovery-sheet exports. It also runs the BIP39 and BIP32 published
vectors directly against the application code. It is the only part of the
toolchain that needs a browser; the server, build, and test harness are
dependency-free Node.js.
